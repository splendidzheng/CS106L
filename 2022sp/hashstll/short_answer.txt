Assignment 3: STL HashMap (short answer questions)
Names: Charles
1. at() vs []
    operator[] does not throw exceptions,if a key is not found. Instead, it will create a K/M pair for that key with a default.
2. Find vs. 𝓕𝓲𝓷𝓭
    std::find() will just move forward to see whether meet the key. However HashMap::find will just jump to the bucket that is possible.
3. RAII
    Not exactly, although it distribute resources at initial and free it after quitting, it lack some SMFs.
4. Increments
    When the next of node is nullptr, it will check for next bucket, or it will go for it.A nd if it meet the end, it just return end()
